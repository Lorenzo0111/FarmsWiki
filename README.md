# Installation

## Buying the plugin

The first thing to do is buying the plugin. You can do this just hitting the buy plugin on SpigotMC.

## Installing the plugin

The plugin doesn't require any other plugin, so the only thing to do is to drag the plugin jar in your plugins folder.

## Installing the \*optional\* addons

### WorldGuard

If you install worldguard and you [enable](addons.md) it, farms will use it to check if player can build in a zone.

### Vault

If you install vault and you [enable](addons.md) it, farms will use it to manage economy, you will also need an economy provider, for example [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html).
